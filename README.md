## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) to emulate some commands in Linux Terminal- such as `cd` , `echo` and `ls` .

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This section provides all the necessary requirements for deploying the CLI in your machine.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
LinuxOS , Text Editor (VS Code, etc.)
```
Note: Any Linux OS (eg. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop), [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org), etc.) can be used without issues.
### Installing

There is no installation required. You only need to perform the following basic tasks:

Step 1:

```
Download the repository as zip and extract it.
```

Step 2:

```
Open the extracted file using any Text Editor and simply type the following commmands in the terminal:

sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

gcc -o my_shell my_shell.c -lreadline
```

This will bring up the CLI and you are free to use it as it is.


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

As of right now, the CLI has three commands available for use: `cd` , `echo` and `ls` .

Currently this project has entirely been worked on by myself. However, I would certainly add any and all contributors who wish to make sHellYEAH! better.
